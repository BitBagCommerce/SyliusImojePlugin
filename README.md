    ```bash
    $ (cd tests/Application && yarn install)

And now, you can configure your payment method in the admin panel
* first you need to add gateway code for example "ing_code" and set position


  ![Screenshot showing payment method config in admin](doc/details.png)
* To configure the gateway, iMoje, log in to the admin panel


  ![Screenshot showing payment method config in admin](doc/main_imoje.png)
* From "Settings" -> "Data for integration" you can acquire all the needed keys:

* shopKey

  ![Screenshot showing payment method config in admin](doc/data_integration.png)
